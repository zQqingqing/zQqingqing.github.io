# Target Tracking Project

We designed image processing and control algorithms for a two-degree-of-freedom laser workbench equipped with a monocular camera, enabling stepper motor control for target identification and tracking.

## Task specification
1. fitting inverse kinematics(**optional** and not done in video).
2. Scan the QR code to get a color sequence.
3. Use laser to point corresponding target both statically and dynamically.
4. Change next color with step 3.
