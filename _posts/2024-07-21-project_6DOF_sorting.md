# Target Tracking Project

We developed forward and inverse kinematics and trajectory planning algorithms for a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm platform, achieving dart positioning and transportation.

## Task specification
1. Taking a photo of the plane and get their position(not shown in video).
2. Mark half of the darts as the destination of the other half.(e.g. 3 origination 3 destination for 6 darts)
3. Place every dart to their assigned destination steadily and accurately.
4. Reset to the initial position.
